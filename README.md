In this project Image Stitching is being reviewd with the use of 2, 3 and 4 images. 

* The common attributes between the images are detected with the use of SIFT algorith.
* Afterwards, RANSAC algorithm is implemented to find the model with the largest number of inliers with the use of the homography matrix.
* Lastly, the image is warped and blended and the final stitched image is being saved.
